# basic-sass-starter

<p>
A basic starter file structure I use for personal and freelance projects. Includes a basic .gulp setup and a minimal css framework/helper class library
</p>

<p>
This is just a starting point, and there's no kind of JS setup, just jQuery. Modify it, use it, it's all up to you!
</p>

<li>Mixins designed to make responsive media queries cleaner </li>
<li>Basic helper classes with a variables file that's easy as cake to edit </li>
</ul>
